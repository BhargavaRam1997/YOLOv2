# YOLOv2
Keras implementation of YOLOv2 refer to Andrew Ng

## Inspiration

This code mainly refers to deeplearning.ai by Andrew Ng.

## Pretrain Model

You also need a pretrained YOLOv2 model,you can get it from official YOLO website ,but here I have already uploaded a h5 file on
[Google Driver](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1v-V94VX2JWIrsDN4u8t9QUCMfzS6x08c).Feel free to download,and put it into model_data 
directory.

## Results

Seems some outputs are not good.You maybe can train it by yourself to  get better,you need to download COCO datasets or others.
